HERO(LIVE）

Mariah Carey

Music Box

Theres a hero

If you look inside your heart

You dont have to be afraid

Of what you are

Theres an answer

If you reach into your soul

And the sorrow that you know

Will meit away

And then a hero comes along

With the strength to carry on

And you cast your fears aside

And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And youll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

Its a long road

When you face the world alone

No one reaches out a hand

For you to hold

You can find love

If you search within yourself

And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along

With the strength to carry on

And you cast your fears aside

And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And youll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

Lord knows......

Dreams are hard to follow

But dont let anyone

Tear them away

hold on

There will be tomorrow

In time youll find the away

And then a hero comes along

With the strength to carry on

And you cast your fears aside

And you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And youll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you...

That a hero lies in you......
